This was a course taken in civil engineering. We learned about the nature of static structures, including concepts such as stress/strain, Euler/thin-plate buckling, shear, bending/deflections, bridges, concrete, and more.
We also built a bridge out of matboard to hold up steel trains that weight up to 1010N, or 103kg.
